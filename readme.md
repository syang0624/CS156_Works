# CS156 Pre-Class Work
This is your personal repository for you to upload your pre-class work submissions. Please note that a folder has been created for each session. Once you have cloned your repository onto your computer, you will need to ensure that you [add](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-add/) and [commit](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-commit/) your work to the correct folder, and [push](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-push/) back to your online repository prior to each class. Here are some tips to make the process easier:

1. You will find it convenient to do your pre-class work in Jupyter notebooks. Use markdown cells where appropriate to explain your working.
2. Feel free to make multiple commits as you keep working on your pre-class work. Git is a powerful tool for version control used widely in industry, and this practice will serve you well later on. Regular commits make it possible to revert to earlier versions of your code if you accidentally break something by making a change.
3. For those of you using them, there is no need to commit Python virtual environments into the repository, since these will often be quite large. They can be found in a folder .venv. You can ensure that they are not committed by adding them to a [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file. You can also add other files and folders here that you wish to keep untracked.
4. Those of you who prefer to work in Google Colab, it is possible to link this directly to your GitHub repository. Please see the example [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb).
5. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a GUI to add, commit and push submissions, for those who prefer using a graphical interface to using terminal directly.
6. In many cases, if you are using a pretty standard dataset, then there is no need to commit it to the repo. If you have performed a lot of preprocessing, or data augmentation, or if the dataset is pretty small (<10MB), then please consider adding it to the repo!
