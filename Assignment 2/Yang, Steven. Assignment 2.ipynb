    "The Lending Club has made an anonymized set of data available for anyone to study here or if you do not have a lending club account the data is also available on Kaggle here. Descriptions of the columns can be found here under 'LoanStats' and 'RejectStats'.\n",

    "The Lending Club is a platform which allows the crowdfunding of various loans. Various investors are able to browse the profiles of people applying for loans and decide whether or not to help fun them.\n",
